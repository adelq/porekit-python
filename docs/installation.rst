Installation
============

Use Python 3.5!
---------------
I recommend installing this inside an Anaconda virtual environment. Anaconda
is a distribution of common scientific Python packages and the conda package
manager simplifies handling binary dependencies for Python and R packages.

As Porekit is at a very early state in its development, you should probably
clone this github repository and run `python setup.py develop`.
